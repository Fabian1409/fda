        "In a distributed storage system that utilizes consistent hashing, the keys are assigned to nodes as follows. Identifiers are ordered on an identifier circle modulo $2^m$. Key $k$ is assigned to the first node whose identifier is equal to or follows (the identifier of ) $k$ in the identifier space. This node is called the successor node of key $k$. If identifiers are represented as a circle of numbers from $0$ to $2^m − 1$, then `successor(k)` is the first node clockwise from $k$. The identifier circle is also called the Chord ring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Chord protocol supports just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Depending on the application using Chord, that node might be responsible for storing a value associated with the key. Chord uses consistent hashing to assign keys to Chord nodes. Consistent hashing tends to balance load, since each node receives roughly the same number of keys, and requires relatively little movement of keys when nodes join and leave the system. Please refer to the lecture materials and the paper [Chord: A P2P Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf) for further details.\n",
